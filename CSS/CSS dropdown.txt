Basic Dropdown
Create a dropdown box that appears when the user moves the mouse over an element.


Example Explained
HTML) Use any element to open the dropdown content, e.g. a <span>, or a <button> element.

Use a container element (like <div>) to create the dropdown content and add whatever you want inside of it.

Wrap a <div> element around the elements to position the dropdown content correctly with CSS.

CSS) The .dropdown class use position:relative, which is needed when we want the dropdown content to be placed right below the dropdown button (using position:absolute).

The .dropdown-content class holds the actual dropdown content. It is hidden by default, and will be displayed on hover (see below). Note the min-width is set to 160px. Feel free to change this. Tip: If you want the width of the dropdown content to be as wide as the dropdown button, set the width to 100% (and overflow:auto to enable scroll on small screens).

Instead of using a border, we have used the CSS3 box-shadow property to make the dropdown menu look like a "card".

The :hover selector is used to show the dropdown menu when the user moves the mouse over the dropdown button.
