Styling Input Fields
Use the width property to determine the width of the input field:


The example above applies to all <input> elements. If you only want to style a specific input type, you can use attribute selectors:

input[type=text] - will only select text fields
input[type=password] - will only select password fields
input[type=number] - will only select number fields
etc..




Padded Inputs
Use the padding property to add space inside the text field.

Tip: When you have many inputs after each other, you might also want to add some margin, to add more space outside of them:

Note that we have set the box-sizing property to border-box. This makes sure that the padding and eventually borders are included in the total width and height of the elements. 



Bordered Inputs
Use the border property to change the border size and color, and use the border-radius property to add rounded corners:

If you only want a bottom border, use the border-bottom property:

Colored Inputs
Use the background-color property to add a background color to the input, and the color property to change the text color:



Focused Inputs
By default, some browsers will add a blue outline around the input when it gets focus (clicked on). You can remove this behavior by adding outline: none; to the input.

Use the :focus selector to do something with the input field when it gets focus:


Input with icon/image
If you want an icon inside the input, use the background-image property and position it with the background-position property. Also notice that we add a large left padding to reserve the space of the icon:



Animated Search Input
In this example we use the CSS3 transition property to animate the width of the search input when it gets focus.



Styling Textareas
Tip: Use the resize property to prevent textareas from being resized (disable the "grabber" in the bottom right corner):
