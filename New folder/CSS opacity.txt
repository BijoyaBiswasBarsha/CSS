The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element.

Transparent Image
The opacity property can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0. The lower value, the more transparent:


Note: IE8 and earlier use filter:alpha(opacity=x). The x can take a value from 0 - 100. A lower value makes the element more transparent.


Transparent Hover Effect
The opacity property is often used together with the :hover selector to change the opacity on mouse-over:


Example explained
The first CSS block is similar to the code in Example 1. In addition, we have added what should happen when a user hovers over one of the images. In this case we want the image to NOT be transparent when the user hovers over it. The CSS for this is opacity:1;.

When the mouse pointer moves away from the image, the image will be transparent again.


Transparent Box
When using the opacity property to add transparency to the background of an element, all of its child elements become transparent as well. This can make the text inside a fully transparent element hard to read:



Transparency using RGBA
If you do not want to apply opacity to child elements, like in our example above, use RGBA color values.
