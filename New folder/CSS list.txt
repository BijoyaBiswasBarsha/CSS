HTML Lists and CSS List Properties
In HTML, there are two main types of lists:

unordered lists (<ul>) - the list items are marked with bullets
ordered lists (<ol>) - the list items are marked with numbers or letters
The CSS list properties allow you to:

Set different list item markers for ordered lists
Set different list item markers for unordered lists
Set an image as the list item marker
Add background colors to lists and list items
Different List Item Markers
The list-style-type property specifies the type of list item marker.





When using the shorthand property, the order of the property values are:

list-style-type (if a list-style-image is specified, the value of this property will be displayed if the image for some reason cannot be displayed)
list-style-position (specifies whether the list-item markers should appear inside or outside the content flow)
list-style-image (specifies an image as the list item marker)
If one of the property values above are missing, the default value for the missing property will be inserted, if any.
